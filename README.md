# trASLate : the app

trASLate is a simple webapp built using REACT that translates ASL alphabet to English. The ML model is built using Tensorflow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of 1000 images of ASL alphabets. The model is then converted to a tensorflow.js model and is used in the webapp. The webapp is built using React and is deployed on Heroku.

if you want to use your own model in the app instead of mine, I have a repsitory with the code required to create the model I used.
